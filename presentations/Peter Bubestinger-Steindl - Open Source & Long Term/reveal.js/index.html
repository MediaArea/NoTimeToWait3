        These reasons actually apply to: "why someone quits a job".
        Therefore also to proprietary software, but you just don't see it that often from "outside", as it's company-internal dynamics.

        Providing means for developers to stay on, or adopt a project will not
        only avoid it becoming abandoned, but will improve its qualities:
        stability, features and GUI.

        It btw hurts if you see your program in use on almost every computer in
        the world, but you have to book a 6 bed hostel dorm for this

        spending their users money on unnecessarily expensive hotel suites.

    That's why proprietary software seems superior sometimes:<br />
    <strong>You</strong> make them <strong>afford</strong> to work on it.
